They wanted to build a scalable distributed banking system for greater agility and increased transactional speed. The legacy architecture did not support frequent release of next-gen applications and features. There was a need to build new digital capabilities with better security, scalability and availability without incurring any downtime post digitalization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Solution<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>The banks deploys microservices in Kubernetes cluster for secure and upgraded architecture.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scalehigh Technologies elevated the security posture of the bank, which helped to reduce the cyberattack surface, without any service disruptions. Scalehigh Technologies re-architected Java applications hosted in EC2 to microservices, developed front-end UI for a mobile platform, and designed infrastructure to stream high velocity of customer requests by deploying Kafka nodes on AWS EKS clusters. By automating the foundation through Terraform, Scalehigh Technologies built the AWS account structure to host the business applications, Kafka nodes and microservices. Scalehigh Technologies automated DevSecOps pipelines built in Jenkins and integrated with Sonar and Nexus tools to ensure the security of the new microservices architecture, further remodeling it with Kafka to decouple sender and receiver services via asynchronous messaging for a fast and reliable inter-service messaging facility. Role-based access controls (RBAC) were leveraged to secure Kubernetes API server operations and improved security posture of the AWS environment\u2019s Kubernetes clusters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefit<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>The bank is now able to respond to customer requirements across channels in real time.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>TCS helped the client adopt microservices-based architecture for accelerated delivery of applications and features.
